        <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
        <h2>Software Developer | Board Game Geek | Coffee Roaster</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Dustin Miller, and I'm excited to share a little about myself with you. My world is a mix of tech, board games, and a serious love for espresso.</p>
        <h3>A Bit About My Journey</h3>
        <p>For almost seven years, I built a career in wealth management. It was rewarding, sure, but something was missing. That "aha" moment hit when I started working on tech projects with a friend. I realized how much I loved solving problems, building new things, and learning constantly. It sparked my decision to dive headfirst into software development.</p>
        <h3>Making the Leap</h3>
        <p>Switching careers wasn’t easy, but it’s been incredibly fulfilling. My experience in finance taught me skills like critical thinking, clear communication, and an eye for detail – all of which are pretty handy in tech! Now, I’m combining those strengths with my passion for coding, and it feels like the perfect fit.</p>
        <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
        <p>When I’m not deep into code, I’m usually diving into one of two passions: coffee and board games. Coffee isn’t just a drink for me—it’s a hobby and an art. From roasting my own beans to perfecting the ultimate espresso shot, I love exploring every part of the process. It’s a blend of creativity and precision that feels oddly similar to coding.</p>
<p>Whether it’s strategizing over a complex eurogame, delving into the epic adventures of a dungeon crawler, or laughing through a fast-paced party game, I love the variety and connection that board games bring. Each one offers a unique mix of challenge, teamwork, and fun that keeps me coming back for more.</p>
<p>Both hobbies give me a chance to unplug, connect with people, and recharge my creativity. They’re my perfect balance to the logical, structured world of software development.</p>
        <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
        <p>Whether you’re into tech, coffee, board games, or just want to connect, I’d love to hear from you. This journey is better shared, and I’m all about learning and creating with others.

Thanks for checking out my corner of the internet. Let’s create cool things, share ideas, and enjoy a great cup of coffee along the way.</p>
